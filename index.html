            Hi, I'm <strong>Saripada, Abdel-Arip</strong> â€” a passionate
            <em>Web Developer</em> who enjoys building elegant, user-focused
            digital experiences. My goal is to create clean, responsive websites
            that offer a seamless user experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            With skills in <span class="highlight">HTML</span>,
            <span class="highlight">CSS</span>,
            <span class="highlight">JavaScript</span>, and modern frameworks, I
            enjoy turning ideas into reality through code.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of coding, I enjoy
            <em>reading, hiking, and exploring new technologies</em>. I'm always
            open to learning new things and collaborating with others.
